            <p>Hello! My name is Deilyn Zamudio Córdova, and I am from Valparaíso Region, Chile.</p>
            <p>With Aymara heritage on my father's side, I'm deeply interested in learning</p>
            <p>to speak the dialect. I'm 22 years old and I'm currently an EnglishConnect teacher.</p>
            <p>I absolutely love doing artistic makeup!</p>

            <img src="images/torres-del-paine-chile.jpg" alt="Chile">
            <p>Chile is a long and narrow country located in the southern part of the world. Bordered 
              by the Andes Mountains to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west, Chile is the longest 
              country globally in relation to its width, a characteristic that provides it with an immense 
              variety of beautiful landscapes and a diversity of climates, ranging from desert to glaciers, 
              and forests to beaches, even including the ancient moai sculptures of Easter Island. Its vibrant 
              culture combines indigenous traditions with Spanish influences. The official language is Spanish;
              however, multiple dialects are spoken within its borders, such as Aymara, Quechua, Rapa Nui, Kawésqar, 
              Yagán, Mapudugun, and Ckunza. Indeed, as beautifully proclaimed in our national anthem, it can truly be
              said that Chile is the joyful reflection of the Garden of Eden.</p>
