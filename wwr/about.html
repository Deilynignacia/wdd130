                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        Destiny's Wake was born from a singular, powerful vision: to bridge the gap between 
                        the fantastical adventures we read about and the raw, exhilarating reality of living one.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Destiny's Wake was forged on the belief that every individual holds an epic within them,
                        waiting to be unleashed by the untamed spirit of the river.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our rafting expeditions are tailored narratives. Depending on your unique 
                        character archetype, specific river paths and heroic quests await. Each journey is brought 
                        to life by your Narrator-Guide, a dedicated crew member who not only navigates the currents 
                        but also weaves your personal story, providing insights and challenges perfectly aligned with 
                        your chosen role. This ensures that every paddle stroke contributes to an epic lived experience, 
                        where you truly become the protagonist.</p>
